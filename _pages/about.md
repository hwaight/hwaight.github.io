Welcome! I'm an assistant professor at the University of Oregon [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.uoregon.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in May 2022 from  Princeton University's [Sociology Department](https://sociology.princeton.edu/) and was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/) (CSMaP) at New York University.

I am a political sociologist interested in politics of media and information and their implications for social organization. 

One strand of my work studies the politics of information control in authoritarian regimes, especially China. I measure the existence and amplification of state propaganda in domestic newspapers, global web-based news, and through new digital platforms like generative AI. See my recent article on these topics in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2408260122) (with Yin Yuan, Molly Roberts, and Brandon Stewart). Replication data available [here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SHT7U4).

A second strand of my work is interested in the politics of popular perceptions. My recent article with Adam Goldstein in the [American Journal of Sociology](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/736841) investigates the shifting bases of inequality perceptions in the United States and how they have evolved alongside political and economic polarization in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. I also have work investigating how individuals in state controlled media environments discern state manipulated articles from more independent sources of information.  

Methodologically I use a range of tools, including primary document analysis, interviews, machine learning, survey experiments, and computational text analysis. I hold a BA in East Asian Studies and an MA in Regional Studies: East Asia, both from Harvard University.
