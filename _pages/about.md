Welcome! I'm an assistant professor at the University of Oregon [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.uoregon.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in May 2022 from  Princeton University's [Sociology Department](https://sociology.princeton.edu/) and was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/) (CSMaP) at New York University.

I study the control and reception of information in authoritarian regimes with a particular focus on China. I conceptualize propaganda as an intervention into the media sphere and develop approaches to measure the existence and amplification of state propaganda in domestic newspapers, global web-based news, and through new digital platforms like generative AI. See my recent article on these topics in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2408260122) (with Yin Yuan, Molly Roberts, and Brandon Stewart). Replication data available [here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SHT7U4).

I also have completed and ongoing projects in the sociology of perception, history of social thought, and gendered online harassment and social media participation. 

Methodologically I use a range of tools, including primary document analysis, interviews, machine learning, survey experiments, and computational text analysis. I hold a BA in East Asian Studies and an MA in Regional Studies: East Asia, both from Harvard University.
